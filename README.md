If you have no time for reading and implementing bullshit description of [Open
Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me) for your awesome website, then this library is
for you. OGP provides fluent APIs to build standard Open Graph objects that can
be included in Go templates, with less headache.

_Note_. This is not an Open Graph metadata parser (yet)!

## Getting Started

Use `go get` to install OGP library into your awesome project:

```sh
$ go get -u gopkg.in/ogp.v1
```
